## Noriyama Kannosuke
Is a name I gave myself.
- **Noriyama** (典山): lit. _book mountain_, because I grew with house full of books.
- **Kannosuke** (漢之助): lit. _helper of people_, taken from my given name.

All my favourite languages start with ```P```s.
- ```perl``` (yes, those were dark days).
- ```PHP``` (yes, those were very dark days).
- ```python```.

I was lucky to start by the end of 2.7, so I was actually started with 3.6.
Basically I never saw the dark days.

My favourite animal is the penguin. Another one that starts with a ```P```.
I was a former Linux user turned Apple user.

I do a bit of bash as well. It is still my current shell of choice.
