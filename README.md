## Noriyama Kannosuke
Is a name I gave myself.

- **Noriyama** (典山): lit. _book mountain_, because I grew with house full of books.
- **Kannosuke** (漢之助): lit. _helper of people_, taken from my given name.

### ```P```s
All my favourite languages start with ```P```s.
- ```perl``` (yes, those were dark days).
- ```php``` (yes, those were very dark days).
- ```python```.

I was lucky to start by the end of ```2.7```, so I actually started with ```3.6```.
For the experienced python users I'm a naive summer child.

### More ```P```s
My favourite animal is the ```penguin```. Another one that starts with a ```P```.
I was a former Linux user turned Apple user.

My favourite car is the **Peugeot 206**, and my favourite character / cloth from the
_Saint Seiya_ manga is **Poseidon**.

### Enough with the ```P```s
I do a bit of ```bash``` as well. It is still my current shell of choice.
